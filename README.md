#  Metal Test

_Swift edition_

This is me experimenting with the [Metal sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_lessons) provided by Apple. It's nothing fancy, but it might prove useful as a reference for me or others.

## Looking at each example

Each code example is provided as [a tag](https://github.com/edwardloveall/metal-test-swift/tags) that you can download specifically or check out locally:

```shell
git checkout hello-triangle

# do whatever you'd like with the example

git checkout master # to reset
```
